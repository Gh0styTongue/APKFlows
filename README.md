# APKFlows

**APKFlows** is a collection of detailed API workflow documentation reverse-engineered from Android APK apps. Each document provides a breakdown of how apps interact with their backend services, including:

- API endpoints
- Request methods (GET, POST, etc.)
- Headers and payloads
- Authentication flows (OAuth2, tokens, etc.)
- DRM license handling (if applicable)
- Response handling logic

This repository focuses on accurate, real-world data extracted directly from APK files. Third-party services like Firebase are generally excluded unless essential (e.g., Google OAuth2).

## üìÇ Contents

Each app has its own documentation PDF outlining:

- API structure and endpoints
- Request/response examples
- Error handling logic
- Special workflows (e.g., Widevine DRM)

## üéØ Purpose

The goal is to provide transparency into how mobile apps communicate with their backend services. This is useful for:

- Reverse engineering
- API testing
- Security research
- Learning app architectures
